	    <p id="thumbdesc">After thousands of people click on articles known as "clickbait", they can barely believe their own eyes. The clickbait article disappoints every single person that clicks them. This is because of the attention-grabbing titles that many click, despite the knowledge that the article is "clickbait". According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, clickbait is "online material (such as headlines) designed to make readers want to click on hyperlinks especially when the links lead to content of dubious value or interest."
