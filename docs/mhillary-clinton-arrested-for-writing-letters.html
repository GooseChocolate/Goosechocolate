    <h1 id="storytext">CHAPPAQUA, NY - Hillary Clinton, Democratic candidate for the 2016 presidential campaign, was arrested earlier this week for writing letters to her family this holiday season. "As soon as the letter was sent to me, I called 911 with no hesitation," said Tony Rodham, Hillary Clinton's brother, who is now in witness protection. "I just knew it was the right thing to do since, as we all know, political candidates are not at all allowed to have a personal life." Hillary Clinton is also suspected to have sent a Christmas card to her daughter all while she knows that it is seen as immoral to be politically incorrect. ITS A HOLIDAY CARD, HILLARY!</h1>
