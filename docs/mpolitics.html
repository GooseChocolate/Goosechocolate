	    <p id="thumbdesc">MINOT, ND - As a result of this upcoming election, a massive group of people banded together to mass-migrate to Canada to avoid seeing the chaos that is believed to ensue. Eight commercial jets were seen above North Dakota followed by approximately 3600 people jumping out in wingsuits and flying over the border into Canada. "It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen" said Gregory Evans, "Once I realized that they were people not birds, I wanted to join them!" Many people have jokingly said that they will move to Canada to avoid dealing with the next president, but no one seemed to take them seriously until now.

	    <p id="thumbdesc">Based on a Tweet by Donald Trump (@realdonaldtrumtrump), he still believes that Obama is a Muslim. Just as usual, Trump is trying to find any way to make Obama seem bad. This Tweet is especially bad because, obviously, one is not allowed to become the president of the United States of America if they are a Muslim. Every single president must be a Christian. Donald Trump should read the Bill of Rights.</p></a>

"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be located, and not about building bridges, is not a Christian." says the Pope. Trump, after hearing this news and knowing that being a Christian is the most important aspect of becoming the president of a country where freedom of religion is 100% allowed, fired back at Pope Francis by saying, "For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful."</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CHARLESTON, SC - Donald Trump, while giving a speech in Charleston, South Carolina, had his hair fly right off of his head. While no pictures were taken of the incident, many witnesses claim to have seen Trump's hair be taken by the wind, then fly off into the distance like a bird. Conspiricies have popped up claiming that Trump is actually an alien and his hair is his messanger to and from his home planet. Although many are confused as to why the hairpiece messanger flew off when it did, some say that Trump, while public speaking, accidentally told the hairpiece to fly off in his native language.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CHAPPAQUA, NY - Hillary Clinton, Democratic candidate for the 2016 presidential campaign, was arrested earlier this week for writing letters to her family this holiday season. "As soon as the letter was sent to me, I called 911 with no hesitation," said Tony Rodham, Hillary Clinton's brother, who is now in witness protection.

Hillary Clinton is also suspected to have sent a Christmas card to her daughter all while she knows that it is seen as immoral to be politically incorrect. ITS A HOLIDAY CARD, HILLARY!</p></a>
