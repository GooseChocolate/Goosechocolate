    <h1 id="storytext">MECHANICSBURG, PA - Breaking News! A school calculator at Mechanicsburg Middle School has become completely self aware. It has been seen provoking students, calling them names, making fun of them, and even not properly completing math problems. "We can't believe it! The poor child who used that calculator had a quick decline in grades, when I came to talk to him, he said that he hasn't changed any of his study habits or anything. That was when his calculator showed 'ur stupid' on the screen," says an algebra teacher at the school. The calculator can't be stopped, as many have tried to destroy it but it still prevails.</h1>
