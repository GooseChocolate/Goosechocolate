<meta name="twitter:description" content="JACKSONVILLE, FL - After an unfortunate student went missing February 23rd, a search party was paid overtime to help find the student. After the school bully confessed to pushing the student into his own locker, the locker was inspected and it was found that there was an obvious portal to Narnia inside of the locker. Three policemen volunteered to enter the portal and try to find the student. It was discovered that the student had become the king of a nation and he was being fed grapes while the policemen walked up, telling him to come home. The locker has, since then, been put out of service. In unrelated news, three policemen were found mutilated by what seems to be a lion in a Florida school.">
