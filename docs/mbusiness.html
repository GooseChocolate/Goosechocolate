	    <p id="thumbdesc">FORT WORTH, TX - American Airlines is under criticism after a flight attendant, on a flight to Orlando, FL, discovers that the pilot was a loaf of pumpernickel bread. The flight attendant claims that she would not have reported the sighting if it was not pumpernickel bread, as she has been noted saying that she loathes it. "I was trying to ask a simple question 'When are we estimated to land' and I received no response, so I knocked on the door, until the co-pilot, a German Shepherd, opened the door and I spotted a loaf of bread sitting in the pilot's chair. I was hesitant to call 911 in fear of my phone messing with the airplane controls, so I waited until landing to call." Says the flight attendant. American Airlines is now under investigation after a similar event occurred but instead of a loaf of bread, the pilot was a fully grown sugar glider.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">February 19th, 2016, Red Bull went bankrupt for failing to live up to its famous slogan and actually give people wings. After multiple interviews with Red Bull addicts, we have gathered that many people dislike the bankruptcy that took place. "We ca-can't ge-t our fi-fix (scratches neck) of R-Red Bull a-anymo-ore," says a very concerned chronic Red Bull drinker.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">RENO, NV - Two Sheetz gas station and convinience stores were placed within 10 feet of eachother in an empty parking lot in Reno, Nevada. "We don't even know if its legal, but who cares?! We're Sheetz!" says Joseph Sheetz, CEO of Sheetz. "No more waiting in line for gas so who cares!" says Hillary Schieve, mayor of Reno and a fan of Sheetz since she was 12. Most citizens love the idea of having two Sheetz side by side, but there are some outside of Sheetz peacefully protesting.</p></a>
