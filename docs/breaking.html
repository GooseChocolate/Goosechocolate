Because of this incident, coast guard has been sent in to protect the Floridian border and many volunteers have placed sand bags into a wall formation to protect against the zombies. Despite the zombies being in Atlanta, they are not similar to The Walking Dead zombies. They seem to be more similar to World War Z zombies which is much scarier for the future of humanity. The president has released an official statement saying to place flowers and plants on a necklace and wear it, as the zombies are not vegan and will try their best to stay away from any form of plant matter.</p></a>
