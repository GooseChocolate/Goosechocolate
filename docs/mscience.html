            <a href="wearing-sunglasses-for-too-long-may-cause-blindness.html" title="Wearing Sunglasses For Too Long May Cause Blindness"><img id="thumbpic" src="/resources/story-images/wearing-sunglasses-for-too-long-may-cause-blindness.jpg">
	    <p id="thumbdesc">It's a common thing to see sunglasses worn by blind people, but not many know the real reason. Based on a study conducted by four scientists at Goose Chocolate, wearing sunglasses for an extended period of time may lead to blindness. This is because of the polycarbonate lenses lessening the intensity of light, tricking your eyes into not needing to work as hard. This eye relaxation results in vision loss and, if sunglasses are worn too often, even blindness. The four bright scientists who conducted this research advise everyone to only wear sunglasses when necessary. Due to the majority of the population having very similar structured eyes, everyone is at risk.

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CAMBRIDGE, MA - A recent study at Harvard University has led many professors to believe that all gingers are at least 30% more likely to be ginger. Many ginger students at the prestigious college are shocked at the evidence supporting this claim and they are pondering the trustworthiness of this statement. Some believe the number to be closer to 50% and maybe even 80% while others believe it to be about 20%. The statement seems to be highly controversial, as there has been rioting on campus and large amounts of vandalism. However, only gingers are the ones taking place so there are only about 20 rioters and they have been extremely easy to catch according to multiple security guards.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CAMBRIDGE, MA - Rust. The product of oxygen touching iron, or is it just iron? A group of students at MIT has discovered that oxygen has the same effect on our lungs that it does on iron. "Wake up, America!" says a concerned mother about the safety of her children's lungs because of the terrible chemical. "We have discovered that the rusting of the lungs takes approximately 80 years to kill humans, which is why the life span has been limited all of these years. All we need to do to increase our life span is to stop breathing!" says one of the students.</p></a>
