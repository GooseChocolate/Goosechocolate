	    <p id="thumbdesc">JACKSONVILLE, FL - After an unfortunate student went missing February 23rd, a search party was paid overtime to help find the student. After the school bully confessed to pushing the student into his own locker, the locker was inspected and it was found that there was an obvious portal to Narnia inside of the locker. Three policemen volunteered to enter the portal and try to find the student. It was discovered that the student had become the king of a nation and he was being fed grapes while the policemen walked up, telling him to come home. The locker has, since then, been put out of service. In unrelated news, three policemen were found mutilated by what seems to be a lion in a Florida school.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">Based on a Goose Chocolate survey, people with tattoos are, on average, almost two times as likely to make you do something illegal. It seems like a number of factors are taken into consideration when it comes to the tattoo and illegal actions correlation that include how large the tattoo is, the amount of color used in the tattoo, and the overall symbolism that it has. These factors also are used when relating to the severity of the crime committed.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CAMBRIDGE, MA - After years of pondering and lab experimentation, scientists at the prestigious technical school Harvard University have discovered there is in fact an "I" in "win". "We have heard for years that there is no 'I' in 'team', but little did those thousands of coaches around the world know, there is an 'I' in 'win'," says George Lucas, a professor at Harvard University. "We have been decieved our entire lives," says an anonymous football player at Penn State. Hopefully, college students all throughout the United States can take the important advice to always think about yourself during all kinds of sports.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">ROCHESTER, NY - "I just never thought I would see the day," says concerned mother of one of the two teens who were fined earlier this week for double dipping. At a local birthday party, two teens were caught taking a bit of a chip, then proceeding to put the chip back into the bowl. "We're just so disguisted! We had to shut down the party because of these two misbehaven children!" says the host of the party. "Reports of double dipping have been increasing at an alarming rate. Double dipping crimes have almost tripled since 2009. Awareness of double dipping must be spread and the germs must be stopped for good!" says the local sheriff.</p></a>
