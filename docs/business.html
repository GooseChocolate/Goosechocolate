	    <p id="thumbdesc">FORT WORTH, TX - American Airlines is under criticism after a flight attendant, on a flight to Orlando, FL, discovers that the pilot was a loaf of pumpernickel bread. The flight attendant claims that she would not have reported the sighting if it was not pumpernickel bread, as she has been noted saying that she loathes it. "I was trying to ask a simple question 'When are we estimated to land' and I received no response, so I knocked on the door, until the co-pilot, a German Shepherd, opened the door and I spotted a loaf of bread sitting in the pilot's chair. I was hesitant to call 911 in fear of my phone messing with the airplane controls, so I waited until landing to call." Says the flight attendant. American Airlines is now under investigation after a similar event occurred but instead of a loaf of bread, the pilot was a fully grown sugar glider.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">February 19th, 2016, Red Bull went bankrupt for failing to live up to its famous slogan and actually give people wings. After multiple interviews with Red Bull addicts, we have gathered that many people dislike the bankruptcy that took place. "We ca-can't ge-t our fi-fix (scratches neck) of R-Red Bull a-anymo-ore," says a very concerned chronic Red Bull drinker.</p></a>

"We don't even know if its legal, but who cares?! We're Sheetz!" says Joseph Sheetz, CEO of Sheetz. "No more waiting in line for gas so who cares!" says Hillary Schieve, mayor of Reno and a fan of Sheetz since she was 12. Most citizens love the idea of having two Sheetz side by side, but there are some outside of Sheetz peacefully protesting.</p></a>

"As soon as the letter was sent to me, I called 911 with no hesitation," said Tony Rodham, Hillary Clinton's brother, who is now in witness protection. "I just knew it was the right thing to do since, as we all know, political candidates are not at all allowed to have a personal life." Hillary Clinton is also suspected to have sent a Christmas card to her daughter all while she knows that it is seen as immoral to be politically incorrect. ITS A HOLIDAY CARD, HILLARY!</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CHARLESTON, SC - Donald Trump, while giving a speech in Charleston, South Carolina, had his hair fly right off of his head. While no pictures were taken of the incident, many witnesses claim to have seen Trump's hair be taken by the wind, then fly off into the distance like a bird. Conspiricies have popped up claiming that Trump is actually an alien and his hair is his messanger to and from his home planet. Although many are confused as to why the hairpiece messanger flew off when it did, some say that Trump, while public speaking, accidentally told the hairpiece to fly off in his native language.</p></a>

We had to shut down the party because of these two misbehaven children!" says the host of the party. "Reports of double dipping have been increasing at an alarming rate. Double dipping crimes have almost tripled since 2009. Awareness of double dipping must be spread and the germs must be stopped for good!" says the local sheriff.</p></a>
