                <p id="thumbdesc1">It's a common thing to see sunglasses worn by blind people, but not many know the real reason. Based on a study conducted by four scientists at Goose Chocolate, wearing sunglasses for an extended period of time may lead to blindness. This is because of the polycarbonate lenses lessening the intensity of light, tricking your eyes into not needing to work as hard. This eye relaxation results in vision loss and, if sunglasses are worn too often, even blindness. The four bright scientists who conducted this research advise everyone to only wear sunglasses when necessary. Due to the majority of the population having very similar structured eyes, everyone is at risk.

The clickbait article disappoints every single person that clicks them. This is because of the attention-grabbing titles that many click, despite the knowledge that the article is &#8220clickbait&#8221. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, clickbait is &#8220online material (such as headlines) designed to make readers want to click on hyperlinks especially when the links lead to content of dubious value or interest.&#8221

Eight commercial jets were seen above North Dakota followed by approximately 3600 people jumping out in wingsuits and flying over the border into Canada. "It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen" said Gregory Evans, "Once I realized that they were people not birds, I wanted to join them!" Many people have jokingly said that they will move to Canada to avoid dealing with the next president, but no one seemed to take them seriously until now.

"He just didn't deserve to not be punched in the face. He looked at me funny what else would I have done?" Said Donald Trump in an interview. After being hit with major backlash for punching the child in the face, Donald Trump Tweeted saying, "He has ties to ISIS and should be put in jail." Trump then regained all trust in his supporters and his polls, once again, for whatever reason, spiked in his favor.</p>

                <p id="thumbdesc">FORT WORTH, TX - American Airlines is under criticism after a flight attendant, on a flight to Orlando, FL, discovers that the pilot was a loaf of pumpernickel bread. The flight attendant claims that she would not have reported the sighting if it was not pumpernickel bread, as she has been noted saying that she loathes it. "I was trying to ask a simple question 'When are we estimated to land' and I received no response, so I knocked on the door, until the co-pilot, a German Shepherd, opened the door and I spotted a loaf of bread sitting in the pilot's chair. I was hesitant to call 911 in fear of my phone messing with the airplane controls, so I waited until landing to call." Says the flight attendant. American Airlines is now under investigation after a similar event occurred but instead of a loaf of bread, the pilot was a fully grown sugar glider.</p>

Many ginger students at the prestigious college are shocked at the evidence supporting this claim and they are pondering the trustworthiness of this statement. Some believe the number to be closer to 50% and maybe even 80% while others believe it to be about 20%. The statement seems to be highly controversial, as there has been rioting on campus and large amounts of vandalism. However, only gingers are the ones taking place so there are only about 20 rioters and they have been extremely easy to catch according to multiple security guards.</p>

Despite the zombies being in Atlanta, they are not similar to The Walking Dead zombies. They seem to be more similar to World War Z zombies which is much scarier for the future of humanity. The president has released an official statement saying to place flowers and plants on a necklace and wear it, as the zombies are not vegan and will try their best to stay away from any form of plant matter.</p>

Three policemen volunteered to enter the portal and try to find the student. It was discovered that the student had become the king of a nation and he was being fed grapes while the policemen walked up, telling him to come home. The locker has, since then, been put out of service. In unrelated news, three policemen were found mutilated by what seems to be a lion in a Florida school.</p>

That was when his calculator showed 'ur stupid' on the screen," says an algebra teacher at the school. The calculator can't be stopped, as many have tried to destroy it but it still prevails.</p>

"I just knew it was the right thing to do since, as we all know, political candidates are not at all allowed to have a personal life." Hillary Clinton is also suspected to have sent a Christmas card to her daughter all while she knows that it is seen as immoral to be politically incorrect. ITS A HOLIDAY CARD, HILLARY!</p>

Conspiricies have popped up claiming that Trump is actually an alien and his hair is his messanger to and from his home planet. Although many are confused as to why the hairpiece messanger flew off when it did, some say that Trump, while public speaking, accidentally told the hairpiece to fly off in his native language.</p>
