	    <p id="thumbdesc">WEST ALLIS, WI - Trump, while at a rally at Nathan Hale High School, punched a 10 year old child in the face, after a bus mistakenly dropped off elementary school students at the high school after taking 7 bars of Xanax purchased by various shady 2nd graders. "He just didn't deserve to not be punched in the face. He looked at me funny what else would I have done?" Said Donald Trump in an interview. After being hit with major backlash for punching the child in the face, Donald Trump Tweeted saying, "He has ties to ISIS and should be put in jail." Trump then regained all trust in his supporters and his polls, once again, for whatever reason, spiked in his favor.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">FOXBOROUGH, MA - An alien UFO was spotted on an old broadcast of a Patriots game. There has only been one picture taken of the incident and many citizens believe it to be extremely shocking. Many theorists believe the aliens to have originated from a dwarf planet moon orbiting the distant star Betelgeuse. This is because of the distinct light pattern on the UFO.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CAMBRIDGE, MA - A recent study at Harvard University has led many professors to believe that all gingers are at least 30% more likely to be ginger. Many ginger students at the prestigious college are shocked at the evidence supporting this claim and they are pondering the trustworthiness of this statement. Some believe the number to be closer to 50% and maybe even 80% while others believe it to be about 20%. The statement seems to be highly controversial, as there has been rioting on campus and large amounts of vandalism. However, only gingers are the ones taking place so there are only about 20 rioters and they have been extremely easy to catch according to multiple security guards.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">ATLANTA, GA - Zombies were spotted early afternoon February 23rd in what seems to be a mass migration through Atlanta heading towards Florida. Because of this incident, coast guard has been sent in to protect the Floridian border and many volunteers have placed sand bags into a wall formation to protect against the zombies. Despite the zombies being in Atlanta, they are not similar to The Walking Dead zombies. They seem to be more similar to World War Z zombies which is much scarier for the future of humanity. The president has released an official statement saying to place flowers and plants on a necklace and wear it, as the zombies are not vegan and will try their best to stay away from any form of plant matter.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">JACKSONVILLE, FL - After an unfortunate student went missing February 23rd, a search party was paid overtime to help find the student. After the school bully confessed to pushing the student into his own locker, the locker was inspected and it was found that there was an obvious portal to Narnia inside of the locker. Three policemen volunteered to enter the portal and try to find the student. It was discovered that the student had become the king of a nation and he was being fed grapes while the policemen walked up, telling him to come home. The locker has, since then, been put out of service. In unrelated news, three policemen were found mutilated by what seems to be a lion in a Florida school.</p></a>

Few attack helicopters have been sent on the groundhog-hunt. We have been informed that he is armed and dangerous. People in the Los Angeles area have been told to lock their doors and stay inside. If you are in a building, please remain calm and remain under lockdown. Being an undercover military general, Phil has access to any weapons and vehicles he wishes.

	    <p id="thumbdesc">MECHANICSBURG, PA - Breaking News! A school calculator at Mechanicsburg Middle School has become completely self aware. It has been seen provoking students, calling them names, making fun of them, and even not properly completing math problems. "We can't believe it! The poor child who used that calculator had a quick decline in grades, when I came to talk to him, he said that he hasn't changed any of his study habits or anything. That was when his calculator showed 'ur stupid' on the screen," says an algebra teacher at the school. The calculator can't be stopped, as many have tried to destroy it but it still prevails.</p></a>

This Tweet is especially bad because, obviously, one is not allowed to become the president of the United States of America if they are a Muslim. Every single president must be a Christian. Donald Trump should read the Bill of Rights.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">FORT WORTH, TX - American Airlines is under criticism after a flight attendant, on a flight to Orlando, FL, discovers that the pilot was a loaf of pumpernickel bread. The flight attendant claims that she would not have reported the sighting if it was not pumpernickel bread, as she has been noted saying that she loathes it. "I was trying to ask a simple question 'When are we estimated to land' and I received no response, so I knocked on the door, until the co-pilot, a German Shepherd, opened the door and I spotted a loaf of bread sitting in the pilot's chair. I was hesitant to call 911 in fear of my phone messing with the airplane controls, so I waited until landing to call." Says the flight attendant. American Airlines is now under investigation after a similar event occurred but instead of a loaf of bread, the pilot was a fully grown sugar glider.</p></a>
