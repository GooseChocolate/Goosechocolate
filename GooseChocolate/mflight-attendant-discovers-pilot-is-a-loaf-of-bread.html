    <h1 id="storytext">FORT WORTH, TX - American Airlines is under criticism after a flight attendant, on a flight to Orlando, FL, discovers that the pilot was a loaf of pumpernickel bread. The flight attendant claims that she would not have reported the sighting if it was not pumpernickel bread, as she has been noted saying that she loathes it. "I was trying to ask a simple question 'When are we estimated to land' and I received no response, so I knocked on the door, until the co-pilot, a German Shepherd, opened the door and I spotted a loaf of bread sitting in the pilot's chair. I was hesitant to call 911 in fear of my phone messing with the airplane controls, so I waited until landing to call." Says the flight attendant. American Airlines is now under investigation after a similar event occurred but instead of a loaf of bread, the pilot was a fully grown sugar glider.</h1>
