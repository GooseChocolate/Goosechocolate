	    <p id="thumbdesc">ATLANTA, GA - Zombies were spotted early afternoon February 23rd in what seems to be a mass migration through Atlanta heading towards Florida. Because of this incident, coast guard has been sent in to protect the Floridian border and many volunteers have placed sand bags into a wall formation to protect against the zombies. Despite the zombies being in Atlanta, they are not similar to The Walking Dead zombies. They seem to be more similar to World War Z zombies which is much scarier for the future of humanity. The president has released an official statement saying to place flowers and plants on a necklace and wear it, as the zombies are not vegan and will try their best to stay away from any form of plant matter.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CAMBRIDGE, MA - Rust. The product of oxygen touching iron, or is it just iron? A group of students at MIT has discovered that oxygen has the same effect on our lungs that it does on iron. "Wake up, America!" says a concerned mother about the safety of her children's lungs because of the terrible chemical. "We have discovered that the rusting of the lungs takes approximately 80 years to kill humans, which is why the life span has been limited all of these years. All we need to do to increase our life span is to stop breathing!" says one of the students.</p></a>
