    <h1 id="storytext">CAMBRIDGE, MA - A recent study at Harvard University has led many professors to believe that all gingers are at least 30% more likely to be ginger. Many ginger students at the prestigious college are shocked at the evidence supporting this claim and they are pondering the trustworthiness of this statement. Some believe the number to be closer to 50% and maybe even 80% while others believe it to be about 20%. The statement seems to be highly controversial, as there has been rioting on campus and large amounts of vandalism. However, only gingers are the ones taking place so there are only about 20 rioters and they have been extremely easy to catch according to multiple security guards.</h1>
