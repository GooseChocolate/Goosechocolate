    <h1 id="storytext">CHARLESTON, SC - Donald Trump, while giving a speech in Charleston, South Carolina, had his hair fly right off of his head. While no pictures were taken of the incident, many witnesses claim to have seen Trump's hair be taken by the wind, then fly off into the distance like a bird. Conspiricies have popped up claiming that Trump is actually an alien and his hair is his messanger to and from his home planet. Although many are confused as to why the hairpiece messanger flew off when it did, some say that Trump, while public speaking, accidentally told the hairpiece to fly off in his native language.</h1>
