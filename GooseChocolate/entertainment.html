	    <p id="thumbdesc">CHAPPAQUA, NY - Hillary Clinton, Democratic candidate for the 2016 presidential campaign, was arrested earlier this week for writing letters to her family this holiday season. "As soon as the letter was sent to me, I called 911 with no hesitation," said Tony Rodham, Hillary Clinton's brother, who is now in witness protection. "I just knew it was the right thing to do since, as we all know, political candidates are not at all allowed to have a personal life." Hillary Clinton is also suspected to have sent a Christmas card to her daughter all while she knows that it is seen as immoral to be politically incorrect. ITS A HOLIDAY CARD, HILLARY!</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CHARLESTON, SC - Donald Trump, while giving a speech in Charleston, South Carolina, had his hair fly right off of his head. While no pictures were taken of the incident, many witnesses claim to have seen Trump's hair be taken by the wind, then fly off into the distance like a bird. Conspiricies have popped up claiming that Trump is actually an alien and his hair is his messanger to and from his home planet. Although many are confused as to why the hairpiece messanger flew off when it did, some say that Trump, while public speaking, accidentally told the hairpiece to fly off in his native language.</p></a>
