    <p id="storytext">WEST ALLIS, WI - Trump, while at a rally at Nathan Hale High School, punched a 10 year old child in the face, after a bus mistakenly dropped off elementary school students at the high school after taking 7 bars of Xanax purchased by various shady 2nd graders.
    <p id="storytext">"He just didn't deserve to not be punched in the face. He looked at me funny what else would I have done?" Said Donald Trump in an interview.</p>
    <p id="storytext">After being hit with major backlash for punching the child in the face, Donald Trump Tweeted saying, "He has ties to ISIS and should be put in jail." Trump then regained all trust in his supporters and his polls, once again, for whatever reason, spiked in his favor.</p>
