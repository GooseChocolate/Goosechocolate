    <p id="storytext">MINOT, ND - As a result of this upcoming election, a massive group of people banded together to mass-migrate to Canada to avoid seeing the chaos that is believed to ensue. Eight commercial jets were seen above North Dakota followed by approximately 3600 people jumping out in wingsuits and flying over the border into Canada.</p>
    <p id="storytext">"It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen" said Gregory Evans, "Once I realized that they were people not birds, I wanted to join them!"</p>
    <p id="storytext">Many people have jokingly said that they will move to Canada to avoid dealing with the next president, but no one seemed to take them seriously until now.</p>
