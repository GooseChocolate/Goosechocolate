	    <p id="thumbdesc">MINOT, ND - As a result of this upcoming election, a massive group of people banded together to mass-migrate to Canada to avoid seeing the chaos that is believed to ensue. Eight commercial jets were seen above North Dakota followed by approximately 3600 people jumping out in wingsuits and flying over the border into Canada. "It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen" said Gregory Evans, "Once I realized that they were people not birds, I wanted to join them!" Many people have jokingly said that they will move to Canada to avoid dealing with the next president, but no one seemed to take them seriously until now.

	    <p id="thumbdesc">WEST ALLIS, WI - Trump, while at a rally at Nathan Hale High School, punched a 10 year old child in the face, after a bus mistakenly dropped off elementary school students at the high school after taking 7 bars of Xanax purchased by various shady 2nd graders. "He just didn't deserve to not be punched in the face. He looked at me funny what else would I have done?" Said Donald Trump in an interview. After being hit with major backlash for punching the child in the face, Donald Trump Tweeted saying, "He has ties to ISIS and should be put in jail." Trump then regained all trust in his supporters and his polls, once again, for whatever reason, spiked in his favor.</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">Based on a Tweet by Donald Trump (@realdonaldtrumtrump), he still believes that Obama is a Muslim. Just as usual, Trump is trying to find any way to make Obama seem bad. This Tweet is especially bad because, obviously, one is not allowed to become the president of the United States of America if they are a Muslim. Every single president must be a Christian. Donald Trump should read the Bill of Rights.</p></a>

"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be located, and not about building bridges, is not a Christian." says the Pope. Trump, after hearing this news and knowing that being a Christian is the most important aspect of becoming the president of a country where freedom of religion is 100% allowed, fired back at Pope Francis by saying, "For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful."</p></a>

	    <p id="thumbdesc">CHARLESTON, SC - Donald Trump, while giving a speech in Charleston, South Carolina, had his hair fly right off of his head. While no pictures were taken of the incident, many witnesses claim to have seen Trump's hair be taken by the wind, then fly off into the distance like a bird. Conspiricies have popped up claiming that Trump is actually an alien and his hair is his messanger to and from his home planet. Although many are confused as to why the hairpiece messanger flew off when it did, some say that Trump, while public speaking, accidentally told the hairpiece to fly off in his native language.</p></a>

At a local birthday party, two teens were caught taking a bit of a chip, then proceeding to put the chip back into the bowl. "We're just so disguisted! We had to shut down the party because of these two misbehaven children!" says the host of the party. "Reports of double dipping have been increasing at an alarming rate. Double dipping crimes have almost tripled since 2009. Awareness of double dipping must be spread and the germs must be stopped for good!" says the local sheriff.</p></a>
